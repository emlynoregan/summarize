hello and welcome to another episode of
fully charged plus now a
question we hear many many times is i'd
love to buy an electric car but i've got
nowhere off street to charge it where do
i plug my car in
and what we're looking at today with
steve richardson from connected curb
is a very very interesting solution to
this problem now steve can you tell us
what
what inspired the development of the
connected curb system
so i mean just just to touch so what you
see here today this is
this is what we call the gecko this is
one of our products that sort of sits on
our sort of infrastructure so
connected curb we are not just a cpo
we're what we call a smart
city infrastructure platform and that
supports
ev charging but it also supports 5g
ultra fast broadband
iot sensors micro mobility solutions but
also all the future mobility
solutions that are coming in and
technologies that are coming online such
as induction charging
so that's what connected kirby's in the
shell but um
like i said as you see today this is one
of our geckos the role of this
particular unit you've got here
is essentially to charge your car that's
what its main role is but underneath
that then there is connectivity that
enables it that can't transmit a 5g
signal that's what i guess what i'm
asking
so you could see the square plate on the
bottom so that basically fits over
a square metal box
and in that box that box is what we call
enable then with
power and data so in each box comes a
power duct and a data deck not
necessarily a cable
so what we do then we go down the street
we put one of these boxes outside every
two bays
and then that street's enabled like your
home is enabled for power
at home with a socket in the wall so it
means that when you want an
ev charge point or if you want a 5g
antenna
you know you've got this connectivity in
the street so in
say five years time someone has
developed a really affordable
induction charging system you don't need
to dig up the pavement and take out that
box it's already in there
yeah so what we do so we we've we've
thought about that so with this box has
the data duct and the power duct
that sits underneath and then we we run
a duct that sits underneath the kerb
so that's then ready so if you want to
bring on an
induction charging pad you just put a
call down through the tarmac so you
don't have to dig up the
atomic as well you call down through the
tarmac find the duct
thread the cable up through there and
it's dense so you can remove
the existing charger you just put your
plate on top
that looks like part of the footpath and
then you've got an induction charging
solution so the idea is you never have
to dig up the streets again
so it's all about that connectivity if
you have that
that power and that data at the curb you
can pretty much do what you like
so then the other thing is the street
furniture i mean we've all seen it
there's a car coming along the road and
they pull up on the pavement or they
don't see it or they bash into it or
something it can get damaged so
how much how big a hassle is that for
you with these
you know because i've seen it happen
with charges is a problem and i think
that's a lot
of the issues with the charges you have
on the street now you're right it's it's
right by the curb so inherently
it's going to get hit and when that gets
hit a lot of the time it takes months
and months and that thing is out of
action so
we designed that into our system so it's
a modular system
down to the ducting so the ducting you
can upgrade the cables as and when you
want
but also all the technic technology sits
below the ground
so if this charger got hit that would
just
the say for instance that that socket
was smashed
you've got four bolts that sit on the
top you can remove that
take one out the back of the van and put
a new one on so it's just all of its
plug and play
what you've got there is a post but what
you're talking about where these are
where i've seen them where they're
connected on the street they're on an
existing piece of street fenders you're
not necessarily adding
new street furniture and that is exactly
the point i mean we we won the mayor of
london award for innovation and part of
that was showing that we
are not adding to the street we're not
adding to the street clutter i mean a
lot of the councils they're obviously
very keen to
to get everybody to switch from petrol
and diesel but they don't add these
you know all of this charging
infrastructure all of these charging
hardware into the streets
so part of why we looked at designing
this around that was
it take london for example there is 800
000
uh parking signs in london
that all sit exactly that all sit on one
of these posts they also all sit on the
curb side rather than the pavement don't
they they're all near the stream they're
all near the street so it's exactly fits
in with this so
the idea is we could in theory today
enable all 800 000 with a charge point
but importantly
with fiber so you could put a 5g antenna
that's three meters above the ground so
5g
needs to be around that height and it
all needs to be around 50 meters well
each one of these is around 30 to 40
meters apart
so not only do you get an ev charging
network you also get a 5g
network as well so it becomes this smart
piece of street furniture
a massive part of what we do in
connecticut
is a sustainability piece so i mean
these are recycled plastics the geckos
we've got the the armadillo which we
don't have today but it's on it's on our
website which is a low
sort of impact solution with but that's
made out of three truck tires
so we recycle the tyres of old vehicles
that are getting scrapped
turn them into a charger but also what a
lot of people don't see is the
infrastructure below the ground so all
the duct in
and the node boxes we are looking to
make out of we
source recycled material so all the
ducting
the the node box that goes in the ground
is all made out of recycled plastic so
approximately 4
800 single use plastic bags we use for
every charge point we put in
and then of course if you then add on
top of that two to three lorry tyres
every child wants so
not only are you reducing the pollution
but you're also trying to address the
sustainability piece with the
recycling of the plastics
