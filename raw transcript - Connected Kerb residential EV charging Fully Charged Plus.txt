hello and welcome to another episode of
0:08
fully charged plus now a
0:10
question we hear many many times is i'd
0:12
love to buy an electric car but i've got
0:13
nowhere off street to charge it where do
0:15
i plug my car in
0:16
and what we're looking at today with
0:18
steve richardson from connected curb
0:20
is a very very interesting solution to
0:22
this problem now steve can you tell us
0:24
what
0:25
what inspired the development of the
0:28
connected curb system
0:29
so i mean just just to touch so what you
0:31
see here today this is
0:32
this is what we call the gecko this is
0:34
one of our products that sort of sits on
0:36
our sort of infrastructure so
0:37
connected curb we are not just a cpo
0:40
we're what we call a smart
0:42
city infrastructure platform and that
0:45
supports
0:46
ev charging but it also supports 5g
0:49
ultra fast broadband
0:50
iot sensors micro mobility solutions but
0:54
also all the future mobility
0:56
solutions that are coming in and
0:58
technologies that are coming online such
0:59
as induction charging
1:01
so that's what connected kirby's in the
1:03
shell but um
1:04
like i said as you see today this is one
1:06
of our geckos the role of this
1:08
particular unit you've got here
1:10
is essentially to charge your car that's
1:11
what its main role is but underneath
1:14
that then there is connectivity that
1:15
enables it that can't transmit a 5g
1:18
signal that's what i guess what i'm
1:20
asking
1:20
so you could see the square plate on the
1:22
bottom so that basically fits over
1:24
a square metal box
1:27
and in that box that box is what we call
1:29
enable then with
1:31
power and data so in each box comes a
1:33
power duct and a data deck not
1:35
necessarily a cable
1:36
so what we do then we go down the street
1:38
we put one of these boxes outside every
1:40
two bays
1:42
and then that street's enabled like your
1:44
home is enabled for power
1:45
at home with a socket in the wall so it
1:48
means that when you want an
1:49
ev charge point or if you want a 5g
1:51
antenna
1:52
you know you've got this connectivity in
1:54
the street so in
1:55
say five years time someone has
1:57
developed a really affordable
1:59
induction charging system you don't need
2:02
to dig up the pavement and take out that
2:04
box it's already in there
2:05
yeah so what we do so we we've we've
2:07
thought about that so with this box has
2:09
the data duct and the power duct
2:10
that sits underneath and then we we run
2:13
a duct that sits underneath the kerb
2:15
so that's then ready so if you want to
2:17
bring on an
2:18
induction charging pad you just put a
2:20
call down through the tarmac so you
2:22
don't have to dig up the
2:23
atomic as well you call down through the
2:25
tarmac find the duct
2:26
thread the cable up through there and
2:28
it's dense so you can remove
2:30
the existing charger you just put your
2:32
plate on top
2:33
that looks like part of the footpath and
2:35
then you've got an induction charging
2:36
solution so the idea is you never have
2:38
to dig up the streets again
2:40
so it's all about that connectivity if
2:41
you have that
2:43
that power and that data at the curb you
2:45
can pretty much do what you like
2:47
so then the other thing is the street
2:49
furniture i mean we've all seen it
2:50
there's a car coming along the road and
2:52
they pull up on the pavement or they
2:53
don't see it or they bash into it or
2:54
something it can get damaged so
2:56
how much how big a hassle is that for
2:59
you with these
3:00
you know because i've seen it happen
3:01
with charges is a problem and i think
3:03
that's a lot
3:04
of the issues with the charges you have
3:05
on the street now you're right it's it's
3:07
right by the curb so inherently
3:09
it's going to get hit and when that gets
3:11
hit a lot of the time it takes months
3:13
and months and that thing is out of
3:14
action so
3:15
we designed that into our system so it's
3:17
a modular system
3:18
down to the ducting so the ducting you
3:20
can upgrade the cables as and when you
3:22
want
3:22
but also all the technic technology sits
3:25
below the ground
3:26
so if this charger got hit that would
3:28
just
3:29
the say for instance that that socket
3:31
was smashed
3:32
you've got four bolts that sit on the
3:34
top you can remove that
3:36
take one out the back of the van and put
3:38
a new one on so it's just all of its
3:39
plug and play
3:40
what you've got there is a post but what
3:42
you're talking about where these are
3:44
where i've seen them where they're
3:45
connected on the street they're on an
3:46
existing piece of street fenders you're
3:48
not necessarily adding
3:49
new street furniture and that is exactly
3:51
the point i mean we we won the mayor of
3:53
london award for innovation and part of
3:55
that was showing that we
3:56
are not adding to the street we're not
3:58
adding to the street clutter i mean a
3:59
lot of the councils they're obviously
4:01
very keen to
4:02
to get everybody to switch from petrol
4:03
and diesel but they don't add these
4:06
you know all of this charging
4:08
infrastructure all of these charging
4:09
hardware into the streets
4:11
so part of why we looked at designing
4:14
this around that was
4:15
it take london for example there is 800
4:18
000
4:19
uh parking signs in london
4:22
that all sit exactly that all sit on one
4:25
of these posts they also all sit on the
4:28
curb side rather than the pavement don't
4:29
they they're all near the stream they're
4:30
all near the street so it's exactly fits
4:32
in with this so
4:33
the idea is we could in theory today
4:37
enable all 800 000 with a charge point
4:40
but importantly
4:42
with fiber so you could put a 5g antenna
4:45
that's three meters above the ground so
4:48
5g
4:49
needs to be around that height and it
4:50
all needs to be around 50 meters well
4:52
each one of these is around 30 to 40
4:54
meters apart
4:56
so not only do you get an ev charging
4:58
network you also get a 5g
5:00
network as well so it becomes this smart
5:03
piece of street furniture
5:04
a massive part of what we do in
5:05
connecticut
5:07
is a sustainability piece so i mean
5:11
these are recycled plastics the geckos
5:13
we've got the the armadillo which we
5:15
don't have today but it's on it's on our
5:16
website which is a low
5:18
sort of impact solution with but that's
5:20
made out of three truck tires
5:22
so we recycle the tyres of old vehicles
5:25
that are getting scrapped
5:26
turn them into a charger but also what a
5:29
lot of people don't see is the
5:30
infrastructure below the ground so all
5:32
the duct in
5:32
and the node boxes we are looking to
5:34
make out of we
5:35
source recycled material so all the
5:38
ducting
5:39
the the node box that goes in the ground
5:41
is all made out of recycled plastic so
5:43
approximately 4
5:44
800 single use plastic bags we use for
5:47
every charge point we put in
5:49
and then of course if you then add on
5:51
top of that two to three lorry tyres
5:52
every child wants so
5:54
not only are you reducing the pollution
5:55
but you're also trying to address the
5:57
sustainability piece with the
5:59
recycling of the plastics
6:10
you
